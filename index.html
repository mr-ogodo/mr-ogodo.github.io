        <h3>For more than 50 years, we’ve achieved remarkable success.</h3>
        <p>
          Erikson Institute was one of the first institutions in the country to recognize the importance of a child’s early years. Today, our groundbreaking work continues to define us as pioneers in the field of early childhood and leaders in the essential work to make a positive difference for children, families, and communities.</p>
        <p>
          <h3 id="h12"> With an exclusive focus on educating, serving, and leading in the early childhood field, our work to improve the lives of young children and their families is supported by four pillars:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Innovative academic programs </li>
            <li> Direct service in the community </li>
            <li> Applied research </li>
            <li>Field-wide policy advocacy and influence</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Above all, we remain true to our founding mission and to the conviction that all children deserve an equitable opportunity to achieve their true potential.</p>

More than 7,000 families have been served by our Fussy Baby Network, Center for Children and Families, and Early Childhood Project, a partnership with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. Each year, our students put in more than 35,000 hours of field service at 61 agencies serving 1,500 children and their families.</p>

        <p> We partner with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to transform education for young children in prekindergarten through third grade. Each year, we work with approximately:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 59 partner schools </li>
          <li> 430 teachers and staff </li>

        <h3>Applied research</h3>
        <p> Last year, we dedicated $3.1 million in public and private funding to research in areas including early childhood care, early childhood education, and family support. Current projects are changing the way early childhood professionals approach complex problems. Our groundbreaking research includes several studies that are the first of their kind in the field on topics including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Home visiting </li>
          <li> Mindfulness interventions in the classroom </li>

          <li> Barbara Bowman Leadership Fellows </li>
          <li> McCormick Foundation Executive Fellows </li>
